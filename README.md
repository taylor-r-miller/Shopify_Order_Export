# Shopify_Order_Export
 
Exports orders from a shopify account into a google sheet. The Idea is to schedule the code to run at a specified frequency i.e one a week and will make an api call to shopify to get the new orders. The code is currently configured to run once a week but could be modified to any frequency.
